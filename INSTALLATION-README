This app is in very early development stage so to make sure it works properly, you need to carefully follow these steps:
1. Go into dist/filefinder/ and unzip these files: "UNZIP ME" and "UNZIP ME 2"
2. To launch this app go into dist/filefinder and locate the "filefinder" application.
The whole app is right now really big in terms of size, because of a problem that is being worked on to fix it.
