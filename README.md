# FileFinder
A GUI App made in python that is a fast search tool. It allows you to look for files/folders in your system that either start with a given sequence of characters, contain it, ends with it or is specific. The app then saves the results in form of a txt log file with the path to the found file/folder. The app is currently in development process and many more cool functions are yet to come.

# MAJOR UPDATE COMING
To those few that care about this app and actually use it, THANK YOU!! An update will coming soon (mainly cause I felt like this app was left unfinished). 
# The update will feature:
- Optimazations to make the searching process faster, also to make the app run faster and cleaner (that includes removing test print statements and temporary variables that clutter the app
- Revamped settings tab, a usuless option is being deleted and now they'll be only those settings that matter
- Added results window, you can view the recent scan log right from the app
- Fixing any known bugs
