# FileFinder
A GUI App made in python that is a fast search tool. It allows you to look for files/folders in your system that either start with a given sequence of characters, contain it, ends with it or is specific. The app then saves the results in form of a txt log file with the path to the found file/folder. The app is currently in development process and many more cool functions are yet to come.  Current problems - Can't get the app to a standalone .exe file
