For some reason this program when ran from other PCs is displaying as a Trojan virus and whatnot in Windows Defender as well as other antiviruses.
This is a common issue for apps made with pyinstaller. Link to a discussion about this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44377666/pyinstaller-exe-throws-windows-defender-no-publisher
This isn't of course the only discssuion about this, you can search it online as well. I do not have anything to hide so I am providing the source code in this repo.
Take it from a random unknown dev on the internet - it is safe
So in order to run this you will probably need to disable Windows Defender or make an exception
Cheers to whoever finds this.
